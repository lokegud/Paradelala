# Secure Home-Lab Setup - Project Summary

## What We've Built

This project provides a comprehensive, AI-powered solution for setting up a secure home-lab environment on a VPS with the following components:

### 1. AI Agents
- **Network Scanner** (`agents/network_scanner.py`): Analyzes network topology and connectivity
- **System Analyzer** (`agents/system_analyzer.py`): Evaluates system resources and capabilities
- **Security Auditor** (`agents/security_auditor.py`): Performs security assessment and recommendations

### 2. Interactive Installer
- **Questionnaire** (`src/installer/questionnaire.py`): Collects user preferences through an interactive CLI
- **Configurator** (`src/installer/configurator.py`): Generates configurations based on user input
- **Install Script** (`scripts/install.sh`): Main installation orchestrator

### 3. Key Features
- Automated security hardening (SSH, firewall, fail2ban)
- Choice of services (monitoring, storage, security, development tools)
- Docker-based deployment with docker-compose
- WireGuard VPN for secure remote access
- Reverse proxy with SSL (Nginx or Traefik)
- Automated backup solutions
- Comprehensive monitoring stack

### 4. Services Available
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Uptime Kuma
- **Storage**: Nextcloud, MinIO
- **Security**: Vaultwarden, Authelia
- **Development**: Gitea, Drone CI
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Networking**: Pi-hole, WireGuard

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `sudo bash scripts/install.sh`
3. Follow the interactive questionnaire
4. The system will:
   - Scan your environment
   - Recommend optimal configurations
   - Generate all necessary config files
   - Deploy selected services
   - Set up security measures

## Architecture Highlights

- **Security First**: All services behind reverse proxy with SSL
- **Modular Design**: Choose only what you need
- **AI-Powered**: Intelligent recommendations based on system analysis
- **Automated**: Minimal manual configuration required
- **Production Ready**: Industry best practices throughout

## Next Steps

1. Test the installation on a fresh VPS
2. Add more service options
3. Implement advanced monitoring dashboards
4. Add support for more operating systems
5. Create video tutorials

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps solution combining security, automation, and user-friendly design.
